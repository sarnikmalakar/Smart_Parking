Project Structure

1. main.py: The main dashboard and video processing loop.
2. detector.py: Handles the AI logic (YOLO + EasyOCR).
3. database.py: Manages the SQLite database for entries, exits, and fees.
4. config_manager.py: Allows you to edit parking slots and pricing via the UI.
5. utils.py: A small helper to check if your GPU is being detected.

# AI Smart Parking System (YOLOv8 + EasyOCR)

This is a high-performance license plate recognition and parking management system. It uses YOLOv8 for vehicle detection and EasyOCR for reading plates. Since it's optimized for NVIDIA GPUs (like the RTX 3050 Ti), it can handle live video streams or webcams in real-time.

--- Prerequisites ---

Before you start, make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. 

If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you'll want the **CUDA Toolkit** installed to get the best speeds. If you don't have a GPU, the code will still run on your CPU, just a bit slower.

    '''Getting Started'''

1. Clone the project
Download these files into a single folder on your computer.

2. Install Dependencies
Open your terminal/command prompt in that folder and run the following commands:

bash
-- Basic requirements --
pip install streamlit opencv-python pandas ultralytics easyocr torch torchvision torchaudio

-- Run the App --

#Launch the dashboard using Streamlit:
-- Bash --
python -m streamlit run main.py

--- One final check on your dependencies ---
Because you are using a GPU the standard 'pip install torch' might sometimes grab the CPU version by default.
If your sidebar still says "CPU" after installing everything, run this specific command to force the GPU-enabled version:

-- bash --
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

--- Troubleshooting & Common Issues ---

If you run into an issue, here’s how to fix the most common ones:

-- 1. EasyOCR is taking forever (or timing out)
The first time you run the app, EasyOCR needs to download the detection and recognition models (about 100MB-200MB). 
- Fix: Just hang tight for the first run. Check your terminal; you should see a progress bar. If it fails, check your internet connection and try again.

-- 2. "AttributeError: module 'PIL.Image' has no attribute 'ANTIALIAS'"
This happens because newer versions of the Pillow library changed some names.
- Fix: Run `pip install "Pillow<10.0.0"`. This downgrades Pillow to a version that's compatible with EasyOCR's current requirements.

-- 3. GPU is detected but usage is 0%
Sometimes Windows won't use the dedicated GPU if the laptop is in "Power Saving" mode.
- Fix: 
  1. Plug in your charger (essential for RTX cards).
  2. Go to Windows Settings > System > Display > Graphics.
  3. Find your Python executable (or VS Code) and set it to "High Performance".

-- 4. Bounding boxes are flickering in video
In high-speed footage, the car might move faster than the OCR can keep up, causing the box to disappear for a frame.
- Fix: In `main.py`, I've set the `debounce` to 4 seconds. If you're testing on a highway, try dropping it to 2 seconds or increasing the `conf_thresh` in `detector.py`.

-- 5. "cv2.error" when uploading .webm
If your OpenCV version is stripped down, it might not have the video codecs.
- Fix: Run `pip uninstall opencv-python` and then `pip install opencv-contrib-python`. The "contrib" version has more support for different video formats.
Note for NVIDIA GPU users: If the app says it's running on "CPU" even though you have a GPU;
you might need to install the version of Torch that matches your CUDA version.
Check pytorch.org for the specific command for your setup.

One thing to watch out for: 
EasyOCR is quite RAM-heavy.
With GPU having less VRAM (likely 4GB VRAM or less), if you try to process 4K video(Higher Resolution feed), you might hit an "Out of Memory" (OOM) error. 
Stick to 1080p or 720p footage for the smoothest demo experience.(In this instance)
