# AI Smart Parking System (YOLOv8 + EasyOCR)

This is a high-performance license plate recognition and parking management system. It uses YOLOv8 for vehicle detection and EasyOCR for reading plates. Since it is optimized for NVIDIA GPUs (like the RTX 3050 Ti), it can handle live video streams or webcams in real-time.

## Project Structure

* main.py: The main dashboard and video processing loop.
* detector.py: Handles the AI logic (YOLO + EasyOCR).
* database.py: Manages the SQLite database for entries, exits, and fees.
* config_manager.py: Allows you to edit parking slots and pricing via the UI.
* utils.py: A small helper to check if your GPU is being detected.

NOTE: 
- parking.db is autogenerated upon first run.
- yolov8n.pt contains the weights for the detection model and is downloaded automatically if missing.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher installed.
* NVIDIA GPU Users: You should have the CUDA Toolkit installed to achieve maximum processing speeds.
* Non-GPU Users: If you do not have a dedicated GPU, the code will run on your CPU at a lower frame rate.

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It is best to isolate this project to avoid dependency conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

1. Create the environment:
   Windows: python -m venv venv
   macOS/Linux: python3 -m venv venv

2. Activate the environment:
   Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

## Installation and Getting Started

1. Download all project files into a single folder.
2. Open your terminal in that folder and ensure your virtual environment is activated.
3. Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit opencv-python pandas ultralytics easyocr torch torchvision torchaudio
